# LONG_READ_pipeline
Project: LONG READ start: 19.02.2024

Steps to take:

1. Generate LONG READ data (60000 time points) - save in folder LONG_READ_training_data


2. Split LONG READ into fragments Ã  1200 time points - save in folder LONG_READ_training_data_splitted


3. Basecalling on fragments - save results in folder


4. Rearrange results of fragments back to LONG READ


5. Compare original LONG READ rand_seq with basecalling prediction


Put code into GUI, if there is enough time left
